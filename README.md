## Introduction

Neo4j is a leading graph database platform that allows you to model, store, and query data relationships efficiently. LLaMA2 is a state-of-the-art language model that excels in various NLP tasks. This project combines the strengths of both technologies to perform advanced data analysis and NLP tasks on graph data.

## Features

- **Graph Data Storage**: Efficiently store and manage graph data using Neo4j.
- **NLP Integration**: Leverage LLaMA2 for natural language processing tasks on graph data.
- **Querying and Analysis**: Perform complex queries and analyses on graph data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Neo4j Community or Enterprise Edition
- pip (Python package installer)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neo4j-llama2-integration.git
    cd neo4j-llama2-integration
    ```

2. **Set Up Neo4j**

    Download and install Neo4j from the [official website](https://neo4j.com/download/).

    Start Neo4j and set up a new database. Make note of the connection credentials.

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Configure Environment Variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your Neo4j credentials:

    ```env
    NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
    NEO4J_USER=your_username
    NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Start Neo4j**

    Ensure your Neo4j database is running.

2. **Run the Application**

    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

### Sample Queries

Here are some sample queries you can run against your Neo4j database:

```cypher
MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 10;
